synopsis: Generates ctags for Haskell, incorporating import lists and qualified imports
description: 
    hothasktags generates ctags files for Haskell, with knowledge of import lists 
    and qualified imports.  It provides a smart go-to-definition for Vim, that almost
    always gets it right in the presence of multiple names from different modules.
    .
    You will want to configure Vim to allow dots in keywords, because hothasktags
    generates tags for qualified names.  You can do this with:
    .
    > set iskeyword=a-z,A-Z,_,.,39
    .
    (The 39 is for the prime character)
    .
    Usage is easy, just give hothasktags the names of all the haskell sources you
    want to index and redirect into a tags file.  For example:
    .
    > find . | egrep '\.hs$' | xargs hothasktags > tags
    .
    will index all the hs files under the current directory.
